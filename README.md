# Journal Digital Corpus

Transcriptions of all  the `journal digital` videos. Created with
Swescribe -- a wrapper around WhisperX.



## files

- `/name_year.tsv` pairings of file-name and publication year, based on metadata
  from smdb.
- `/.env` is used to store environmental variables:
   - `JOURNAL_DIGITALROOT` is the **local** absolute path to the videos.
