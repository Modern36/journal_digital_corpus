# Template

This is a template README for setting up new repositories within the
*Modern36* organization on GitHub.

It contains a basic structure that is nice to have for new projects and
it has a workflows set up in the `.github/workflows` directory:

 1. Auto assign:
    - Automatically add assignees all opened issues and pulls requests
    that do not already have an assignee.
    - By default this assignee is @mathjoha


## Usage

1. m36_utils requirement
   - Remove it if not needed
   - Make sure that it is accessible if it is needed
2. Install pre-commit functionalities:
   `pre-commit install`
3. Update this file to describe the repository
4. Commit
